/*
Intermediate file that combines all modules together
If there's a better solution, like using commonjs, let me know
I EXTREMELY prefer 1 over 001, 2 over 002, 50 over 050, but formatting says that I can't do that
I really want to name my files problem1.js, problem2.js, and so on, but formatting says NO
Except for the individual function names :)
